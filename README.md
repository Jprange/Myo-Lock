#Combination Lock

Initially the password is set to fist at lock position 48, then spread hand at point 16, then fist at lock position at 35

The app has the ability for the user to set a custom three gesture and position lock, allowing for a total of six actions that need to be completed in order to unlock the application

#Myo

The alpha version of the Myo allows for five gestures, fist, wave in, wave out, spread, and twist in.
Users are allowed to set and combination of gestures as their password

#Closing

After the user correctly enters the current passcode, the lock spins open and the app closes

#Future Additions

- Add integration with android OS to allow Myo Lock to properly lock applications from opening
- Clean up state machines to increase readability
- Add more advanced locking procedure utilizing all sensor data from Myo
